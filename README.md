Men's Professional Wardrobe Minimizer

This work-in-progress is intended to help those who identify as men purchase or maintain a minimum professional wardrobe given the following assumptions:
1. I'm not counting "everyday" items like socks; only ties, dress shirts and pants (or trousers).
2. Grey and black ties match everything.
3. Otherwise, ties must match shirts; I'm assuming white or primary colors.
4. Only grey or black pants are assumed.
5. Pants may be worn at most two times in a given week. 
6. If an odd number of applicable days, the number of pants should be rounded up.

Note that the user should be able to select the number of ties from none, one black or grey tie, or two ties (one of which is a color other than black or grey).
